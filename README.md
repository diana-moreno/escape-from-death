Escape from death is a horror escape game where you and your friend have been kidnapped. The goal is to rescue your friend and scape both together. Be careful with the killer!

### **Features**

- There are three closed doors: in one is your friend isolated, in other the killer, and in the other, the exit.
- If you find the exit, you won't be able to leave without your friend, you must rescue him first to leave together.
- If while trying to find the exit or your friend, you bump with the killer, the game is over.
